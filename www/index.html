SezPoz is a lightweight and simple-to-learn library that lets you perform modular service lookups.
It provides some of the same capabilities as (for example) <code>java.util.ServiceLoader</code>, Eclipse extension points, and NetBeans <code>Lookup</code> and XML layers.
However, SezPoz has some special advantages:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
      <p>
      The service registrations are made just using type-checked Java annotations.
      There are no configuration files to edit, and your Java IDE can show you registrations since they are simply usages of an annotation.
      On JDK 6, no special build or packaging steps are required (just javac); on JDK 5, you just need to run APT (with default arguments).
      Looking up services just requires that you have a <code>ClassLoader</code> which can "see" all of the "modules" (as with <code>ServiceLoader</code>).
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      You can register individual objects (values of static fields or methods) instead of whole classes.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      You can associate static metadata with each implementation, using regular annotation values.
      The caller can choose to inspect the metadata without loading the actual implementation object (as with Eclipse extension points).
      </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Sources are in the form of NetBeans projects, but you can build them (and run the demo) just using Ant.
</p>
<p>
(Why the name? SezPoz "says" the "position" of your services. It is also a "seznam pozn√°mek".)
